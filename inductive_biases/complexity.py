def lempel_ziv_complexity(sequence):
    r""" Manual implementation of the Lempel-Ziv complexity.

    It is defined as the number of different substrings encountered as the stream is viewed from begining to the end.
    As an example:

    >>> s = '1001111011000010'
    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity(s)  # 1 / 0 / 01 / 11 / 10 / 110 / 00 / 010
    8

    Marking in the different substrings the sequence complexity :math:`\mathrm{Lempel-Ziv}(s) = 8`: :math:`s = 1 / 0 / 01 / 11 / 10 / 110 / 00 / 010`.

    - See the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel-Ziv_complexity for more details.


    Other examples:

    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity('1010101010101010')  # 1, 0, 10, 101, 01, 010, 1010
    7
    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity('1001111011000010000010')  # 1, 0, 01, 11, 10, 110, 00, 010, 000
    9
    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity('100111101100001000001010')  # 1, 0, 01, 11, 10, 110, 00, 010, 000, 0101
    10

    - Note: it is faster to give the sequence as a string of characters, like `'10001001'`, instead of a list or a numpy array.
